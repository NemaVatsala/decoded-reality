    "Remember those spurious class labels? The ones that did not represent the ground truth and were merely proxies for infinitely more complicated social phenomena. What do you think happens when data-driven algorithms get deployed back into the real world? The groups whose identities were erased while determining class labels are further oppressed by algorithmic decision making systems that enforce reductive categorizations in the real world.\n",
