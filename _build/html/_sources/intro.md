Welcome to Decoded Reality
========================

This is a creative exploration of the power dynamics that shape the design, development, and deployment of machine learning and data-driven systems.

The third wave of ethical AI<sup>1</sup> is all about Power<sup>2</sup>.
Power dynamics determine what work we fund, who we build models for and *what problems we try to solve*<sup>3</sup>.
The AI accountability gap<sup>4</sup> enables the ones in power to justify self-interest under the garb of utilitarianism, while the vulnerable are disproportionately affected. The invisible hand of concentrated power has been long overlooked in both scholarship and discourse, but it is the critical confounding factor that renders purely philosophical or purely technical interventions on algorithmic decision-making systems ineffectual.

**Decoded Reality** is a creative exploration of the power dynamics that shape the design, development and deployment of data-driven systems. We present artistic depictions of the social manifestations of algorithmic interventions in order to provoke the viewer to think critically about the socio-political underpinnings of each step of the engineering process.
