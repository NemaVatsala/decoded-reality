    "![Two ethereal forms are in the center of the screen. The one at the back is composed of colorful pixels and has the word ‘Data’’ written in hollow characters behind it. The words ‘Racism’ and ‘Oppression’ are written within the word ‘Data’. The figure in the front is composed of a network of graph nodes/vertices and edges and has the word ‘Model’ written behind it in hollow characters. The word ‘Discriminatory’ is written within the world ‘Model’. Two humans are looking at the ethereal beings. To the right stands a Caucasian male, who is emphatically blowing a kiss to the Model. To the left stands an African-American female, who is looking at the model in disapproval while flames rise around her. ](Optimization.gif)"
