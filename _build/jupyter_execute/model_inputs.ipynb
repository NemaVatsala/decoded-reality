    "![An arcade mechanical picker game is depicted, where the toys are replaced by people’s faces. There’s a stark disparity between the abundance of ‘western’ faces and the dearth of those with darker skin tones. There is a sign on top of the game saying “diverse, ethical, fair” with the faces of prominent scholars Deborah Raji,Timnit Gebru and Joy Boulamwini. A person in a jacket with the logos of big tech companies is seen operating the joystick. His face is superimposed with the words ‘A Silicon Valley type’.The mechanical hand is moving downwards towards the toy faces and has the words Efficiency, Advancement, Progress and Innovation written on it](Data.gif)"

Self-affirming ‘Fairness’ and ‘Ethics’ certificates are stamped onto data collection strategies, while the ground reality remains discriminatory and predatory. \n",
